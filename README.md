Repository for Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition.

# 🧠 Smart Face Recognition-Based Attendance System using IoT & AWS

This project leverages **AI-powered facial recognition**, **IoT devices**, and **AWS cloud services** to automate attendance tracking in classrooms, offices, or smart spaces. It can **identify individuals**, **count people present**, and display **real-time analytics** on a dashboard.

## Workflow OverviewRaspberry Pi captures an image when someone arrives.

1- Image is uploaded to Amazon S3.

2- Upload triggers a Lambda function.

3- Lambda performs SearchFacesByImage in Rekognition collection.

4- If face is recognized, it looks up name and ID from DynamoDB.

5- Lambda then writes an attendance record (FaceID, Name, Timestamp) to a separate Attendance Table.

6- Prevents duplicate entries per day using conditional checks.
