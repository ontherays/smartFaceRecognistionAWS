### üîå **Hardware Setup Steps for Raspberry Pi 4**

1. **Connect USB Keyboard and Mouse**  
   - Plug the **USB keyboard** and **mouse** into the **USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 ports** (blue ports are USB 3.0).

2. **Connect the Camera**  
   - Locate the **camera serial interface (CSI) port** near the HDMI ports.  
   - Gently **lift the plastic clip**, insert the **ribbon cable** from the camera (metal contacts facing the HDMI ports), and press the clip back to secure it.

3. **Connect the Monitor via micro-HDMI**  
   - Use a **micro-HDMI to HDMI cable** to connect your monitor to **one of the two micro-HDMI ports**.  
   - Use the **left HDMI port (HDMI0)** for the primary display.

4. **Connect the Power Supply**  
   - Use a **5V/3A USB-C power adapter** (official Raspberry Pi power supply recommended).  
   - Plug it into the **USB-C power port** on the Pi.

5. **Optional: Connect to Ethernet (Wired Network)**  
   - Plug in an **Ethernet cable** to the **Gigabit Ethernet port** for wired internet access, or use Wi-Fi after booting.
   - **Note-**I used Wifi connection After Booting
  
6 . Flash your desired OS (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS) onto a microSD card using a tool like Raspberry Pi Imager.
   - Install (SD card formator)[https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/sd-memory-card-formatter-for-windows-download/]
   - Choose SD card drive carefully.
   - Formate.
   - Goto (Raspberry Pi OS)[https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/].
   - Install Raspberry Pi Imager for Windows

     - Device - Version of your Raspberry Pi (As PI 4)
     - OS - Compitable with your Device( Raspberry Pi OS(64 bits))
     - Storage - SD card.
     - Click Next > Edit Setting
     - Addition Setting, Choose Hostname, Username, Password, Wifi Seetings and Region.
     - Click Save

   - Flash.
   - Once Donce, Put the SD card in Raspberry Pi module.

7. **Turn It On**  
   - Once power is connected, the Pi will **automatically boot** if the OS is correctly installed on the microSD card.  
   - You'll see the **boot sequence on the monitor**.
